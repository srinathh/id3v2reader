id3v2reader
-----------

id3v2reader is a reader for id3 version 2.3 and 2.4 tags. These are the two most commonly
used ID3 tag formats and seem to be the last somewhat standardized versions.

I wrote this code during my early stages of learning the Go language and as such
may not be very idiomatic. I have yet to revise the code or make proper tests.
